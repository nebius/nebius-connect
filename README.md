# Nebius AI connector for Apache Sparkâ„¢

The [Managed Service for Apache Spark](https://nebius.ai/services/managed-spark), a [Nebius AI](https://nebius.ai/) service, offers access to _sessions:_ managed environments that can handle multiple independent ad-hoc computations at the same time. 

With this connector, you can connect to your Managed Spark sessions using [Spark Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html) and process data with Spark APIs from your machine.

## Installing

```bash
pip install nebius-connect
```

## Example

```py
from pyspark.sql.connect.session import SparkSession
from nebius.spark.connect import create_channel_builder

nebius_spark_cb = create_channel_builder(
    'spsession-example123.nebius.cloud:443',
    password='my-password'
)

spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .channelBuilder(nebius_spark_cb) \
    .getOrCreate()

columns = ["id","name"]
data = [(1,"Sarah"),(2,"Maria")]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data).toDF(*columns)
df.show()
spark.stop()
```
